# .files
These are my dotfiles. They're probably not right for you!

On a new system, install zsh and oh-my-zsh, then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/gordon-krefting/.files.git
```

or

```
git clone git@github.com:gordon-krefting/.files.git
```

in the home directory. (Someday I'll figure out which is better.)

Next, run:

```
.files/setup.sh
```

to create aliases.

If you get any errors, fix the code!

Every once in a while, run ``git pull`` to get the latest.


## Other stuff
Might have a tiny vim (on Pi)
```
sudo apt install vim-gui-common
sudo apt install vim-runtime
```

On first vim use, do ```:PlugInstall```
