# .files
These are my dotfiles. They're probably not right for you!

On a new system, install zsh and oh-my-zsh, then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/gordon-krefting/.files.git
```

or

```
git clone git@github.com:gordon-krefting/.files.git
```

in home directory. (Someday I'll figure out which is better.)

Next, run:

```
.files/setup.sh
```

to create aliases.

If you get any error, fix the code!
